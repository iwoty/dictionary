function,"A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action. Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing.",https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_functions.htm
parameter,"In computer programming, a parameter is a special kind of variable, used in a subroutine to refer to one of the pieces of data provided as input to the subroutine.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter_(computer_programming)
variable,"Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values. This means that when you create a variable you reserve some space in memory.",https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_variable_types.htm
argument,"Pieces of data provided as input.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter_(computer_programming)
dictionary,"Python dictionary is an unordered collection of items. While other compound data types have only value as an element, a dictionary has a key: value pair. Dictionaries are optimized to retrieve values when the key is known.",https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/
tuple,"In Python programming, a tuple is similar to a list. The difference between the two is that we cannot change the elements of a tuple once it is assigned whereas in a list, elements can be changed.",https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/tuple
ASCII table,"ASCII codes represent text in computers, telecommunications equipment, and other devices. Most modern character-encoding schemes are based on ASCII, although they support many additional characters.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII
module,"A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements.",https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html
nested scope,"The ability to refer to a variable in an enclosing definition. For instance, a function defined inside another function can refer to variables in the outer function. Note that nested scopes by default work only for reference and not for assignment. Local variables both read and write in the innermost scope. Likewise, global variables read and write to the global namespace. The nonlocal allows writing to outer scopes.",https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html
object,"Any data with state (attributes or value) and defined behavior (methods). Also the ultimate base class of any new-style class.",https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html
slice,"An object usually containing a portion of a sequence. A slice is created using the subscript notation, [] with colons between numbers when several are given, such as in variable_name[1:3:5]. The bracket (subscript) notation uses slice objects internally.",https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html
statement,"A statement is part of a suite (a “block” of code). A statement is either an expression or one of several constructs with a keyword, such as if, while or for.",https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html
